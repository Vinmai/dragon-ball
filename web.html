        Dragon Ball Z (Japanese: ドラゴンボールＺゼット, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru
        Zetto, commonly abbreviated as DBZ) is a Japanese anime television
        series produced by Toei Animation. It is the sequel to Dragon Ball and
        adapts the latter 325 chapters of the original 519-chapter Dragon Ball
        manga series created by Akira Toriyama which ran in Weekly Shōnen Jump
        from 1988 to 1995. Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan on Fuji TV from April
        26, 1989 to January 31, 1996, before getting dubbed in territories
        including the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, Asia, and Latin
        America. It was broadcast in at least 81 countries worldwide.[4] It is
        part of the Dragon Ball media
      </p>

      <p>
        Dragon Ball Z continues the adventures of Goku, who, along with his
        companions, defend the Earth against villains ranging from aliens
        (Frieza), androids (Cell) and other creatures (Majin Buu). While the
        original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku from childhood to early
        adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adult life, but at the
        same time parallels the life of his son, Gohan, as well as the
        development of his rival Vegeta.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the success of the anime in the United States, the manga chapters
        making up its story were initially released by Viz Media under the
        Dragon Ball Z title. Dragon Ball Z's popularity has spawned numerous
        releases which have come to represent the majority of content in the
        Dragon Ball franchise; including 15 movies, 2 TV specials, and 148 video
        games (many of them being only released in Japan), and a host of
        soundtracks stemming from this material. Dragon Ball Z remains a
        cultural icon through numerous adaptations and re-releases, including a
        more-recent remastered broadcast titled Dragon Ball Kai.[a] There have
        also been two sequel series; Dragon Ball GT (1996–1997) and Dragon Ball
        Super (2015–2018).

        Dragon Ball Z picks up five years after the end of the Dragon Ball
        anime, with Goku now a young adult and father to his son, Gohan. A
        humanoid alien named Raditz arrives on Earth in a spacecraft and tracks
        down Goku, revealing to him that he is his long-lost older brother and
        that they are members of a near-extinct extraterrestrial warrior race
        called the Saiyans (サイヤ人, Saiya-jin). The Saiyans had sent Goku
        (originally named "Kakarot") to Earth as an infant to conquer the planet
        for them, but he suffered a traumatic brain injury soon after his
        arrival and lost all memory of his mission, as well as his bloodthirsty
        Saiyan nature. Goku refuses to help Raditz continue the mission, which
        results in Raditz kidnapping Gohan. Goku decides to team up with his
        former enemy Piccolo in order to defeat Raditz and save his son, while
        sacrificing his own life in the process. In the afterlife, Goku trains
        under the ruler of the North Galaxy, King Kai, and is taught the
        Kaio-ken (界王拳) and Spirit Bomb (also known as the Genki Dama
        (元気玉)) techniques, before being revived by the Dragon Balls a year
        later in order to save the Earth from Raditz' allies; Nappa and the
        self-proclaimed "Prince of all Saiyans", Vegeta, who arrive before Goku
        returns. Piccolo is killed by Nappa during the battle, along with Goku's
        allies Yamcha, Tien Shinhan and Chiaotzu (with Chiaotzu sacrificing
        himself to save Tien), and both Kami and the Dragon Balls cease to exist
        as a result of Piccolo's death. After Goku finally arrives at the
        battlefield, he avenges his fallen friends by defeating Nappa with his
        new level of power. Vegeta executes Nappa for his failure and does
        battle with Goku, but is ultimately defeated thanks to the efforts of
        Gohan and Goku's other surviving allies, Krillin and Yajirobe. At Goku's
        request, they spare Vegeta's life and allow him to escape Earth, with
        Vegeta vowing to return and destroy the planet out of revenge for his
        humiliation at Goku's hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the battle, Krillin overhears Vegeta mentioning the original set
        of Dragon Balls from Piccolo's homeworld, Namek (ナメック星,
        Namekku-sei). While Goku recovers from his injuries, Gohan, Krillin and
        Goku's oldest friend Bulma depart for Namek in order to use these Dragon
        Balls to revive their fallen friends. However, they discover that
        Vegeta's superior, the galactic tyrant Lord Frieza, is already there,
        looking to use the Dragon Balls for himself so that he can achieve
        immortality. A fully healed Vegeta arrives on Namek as well, also
        seeking immortality from the Dragon Balls, which leads to several
        battles between him and Frieza's henchmen. Realizing he is overpowered,
        Vegeta teams up with Gohan and Krillin to fight the Ginyu Force, a team
        of elite mercenaries summoned by Frieza. After Goku finally arrives on
        Namek, the epic battle with Frieza himself comes to a close when Goku
        transforms into the fabled Super Saiyan (超サイヤ人, Sūpā Saiya-jin) of
        legend and defeats him before escaping Namek as the planet is destroyed
        in a massive explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon his return to Earth a year later, Goku encounters a time traveler
        named Trunks, the future son of Bulma and Vegeta, who warns Goku that
        two Androids (人造人間, Jinzōningen, lit. "Artificial Humans") will
        appear three years later, seeking revenge against Goku for destroying
        the Red Ribbon Army when he was a child. During this time, an evil
        lifeform called Cell emerges and, after absorbing two of the Androids to
        achieve his "perfect form", holds his own fighting tournament to decide
        the fate of the Earth, known as the "Cell Games". After Goku sacrifices
        his own life a second time, to no avail, Gohan avenges his father by
        destroying Cell after ascending to the second level of Super Saiyan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seven years later, Goku is revived for one day to reunite with his loved
        ones and meet his youngest son, Goten, at the Tenkaichi Budōkai
        (天下一武道会, "Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament").
        Soon after, Goku and his allies are drawn into a fight by the Supreme
        Kai against a magical being named Majin Buu summoned by the evil wizard
        Babidi. After numerous battles that result in the deaths of many of
        Goku's allies as well as the destruction of Earth, Goku (whose life is
        fully restored by the Elder Supreme Kai) kills Kid Buu (the original and
        most powerful form of Majin Buu) with a Spirit Bomb attack containing
        the energy of all the inhabitants of Earth, who were resurrected along
        with the planet by the Namekian Dragon Balls. Goku makes a wish for Buu
        to be reincarnated as a good person and ten years later, at another
        Tenkaichi Budōkai, he meets Buu's human reincarnation, Uub. Leaving the
        match between them unfinished, Goku departs with Uub to train him to
        become Earth's new defender.
